# PROJECT TITLE:
Detecting Anomalies in Cement Plant Sensor Data

# DESCRIPTION:
This project builds an unsupervised anomaly detection system for monitoring sensor data in a cement manufacturing plant. It identifies irregularities in temperature and pressure readings, helping in predictive maintenance.

# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, Heatmaps

# PROJECT WORKFLOW:
Collected & cleaned sensor data from a cement plant preheater system.
Applied Isolation Forest & Autoencoders for anomaly detection.
Analyzed feature correlations to understand process deviations.
Visualized anomalies using heatmaps & histograms to improve interpretability.
Provided insights for early failure detection & predictive maintenance.
